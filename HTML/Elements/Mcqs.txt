## NESTING OF BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS

✅ Q1 — Valid
html
Copy
Edit
<div>
  <section>
    <article>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </article>
  </section>
</div>
✔️ Correct!
This is clean, semantic, and fully valid. All block-level elements are nested properly, and the hierarchy makes sense structurally.

❌ Q2 — Invalid
html
Copy
Edit
<p>
  <div>This shouldn’t work</div>
</p>
✔️ Correct!
<p> can’t contain block-level elements like <div>. The browser will auto-close the <p> early, causing unexpected layout bugs.

✅ Q3 — Valid
html
Copy
Edit
<form>
  <section>
    <input type="text" />
  </section>
</form>
✔️ Correct!
Block-level <section> inside a <form>? Totally valid. You can structure forms semantically using sections, articles, divs, etc.

❌ Q4 — Invalid
html
Copy
Edit
<ul>
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
</ul>
✔️ Correct!
A <ul> (unordered list) must only contain <li> elements as direct children. <div> is invalid here.

✅ Q5 — Valid
html
Copy
Edit
<article>
  <footer>
    <p>Some footer text</p>
  </footer>
</article>
✔️ Correct!
You can totally use <footer> inside <article>. In fact, it's semantically recommended if you're closing off a single piece of content.

❌ Q6 — Invalid
html
Copy
Edit
<table>
  <div>This won’t fly</div>
</table>
✔️ Correct!
<table> only allows specific tags inside: <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <tr>, etc. Putting a <div> directly in it is invalid.

✅ Q7 — Valid
html
Copy
Edit
<div>
  <p>Intro</p>
  <h2>Subheading</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
  </ul>
</div>
✔️ Correct!
This is textbook good structure. All elements are semantically placed, valid, and cleanly nested.
